config ASPEED_BMC_MISC
	bool "Miscellaneous ASPEED BMC interfaces"
	depends on ARCH_ASPEED || COMPILE_TEST
	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Say yes to expose VGA and LPC scratch registers, and other
	  miscellaneous control interfaces specific to the ASPEED BMC SoCs

config ASPEED_LPC_CTRL
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	tristate "Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST LPC to BMC bridge control"
	help
	  Control Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST LPC to BMC mappings through
	  ioctl()s, the driver also provides a read/write interface to a BMC ram
	  region where the host LPC read/write region can be buffered.

config ASPEED_LPC_MBOX
	tristate "Aspeed LPC Mailbox Controller"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	---help---
	  Expose the ASPEED LPC MBOX registers found on Aspeed SOCs (AST2400
	  and AST2500) to userspace.

config ASPEED_LPC_SIO
	tristate "Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST LPC SIO support"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC SIO interface on ASPEED platform
	  through ioctl()s.

config ASPEED_LPC_SNOOP
	tristate "Aspeed ast2500 HOST LPC snoop support"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC snoop interface which
	  allows the BMC to listen on and save the data written by
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

config ASPEED_P2A_CTRL
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	tristate "Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST P2A VGA MMIO to BMC bridge control"
	help
	  Control Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST P2A VGA MMIO to BMC mappings through
	  ioctl()s, the driver also provides an interface for userspace mappings to
	  a pre-defined region.

config ASPEED_XDMA
	tristate "Aspeed XDMA Engine Driver"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON && HAS_DMA
	help
	  Enable support for the Aspeed XDMA Engine found on the Aspeed AST2XXX
	  SOCs. The XDMA engine can perform automatic PCI DMA operations
	  between the AST2XXX (acting as a BMC) and a host processor.

config ASPEED_VGA_SHAREDMEM
	tristate "Aspeed VGA Shared memory"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED
	help
	  To access VGA shared memory on Aspeed BMC, enable this option.
	  This driver used by ManagedDataRegionlV2 specification. In the
	  specification, BIOS will transfer whole SMBIOS table to VGA memory,
	  and BMC can get the table from VGA memory through this driver.
